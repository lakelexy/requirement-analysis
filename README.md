## Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle that focuses on understanding and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. Its primary purpose is to ensure that the final product aligns with user goals, organizational objectives, and technical feasibility.

Through requirement analysis, developers identify functional requirements (what the system should do), non-functional requirements (how the system should perform), and constraints (limitations or restrictions). This process reduces misunderstandings, minimizes risks, and establishes a clear roadmap for design, development, and testing, ultimately contributing to a successful and cost-effective software project.
